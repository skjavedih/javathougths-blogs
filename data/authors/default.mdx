## My Journey & Expertise

Over the last decade, I’ve had the privilege of working across diverse domains, including **Banking, Telecom, and Logistics**. This journey has taught me that software is more than just writing lines of code—it's about building resilient architectures that can evolve with the business. 

Currently, I am focused on the **Banking sector**, where I deal with the intricacies of security, high availability, and distributed systems daily.

## Why I Started "Java Thoughts"

In the fast-paced world of tech, it’s easy to get lost in "how" to use a library without understanding "why" a system is designed a certain way. I started this blog to bridge that gap. 

**My mission is to help developers transition from being "Coders" to "Architects."** Whether it's mastering the latest features in Java 21, deep-diving into Kafka patterns, or exploring the new frontier of AI-driven development, I aim to provide practical, real-world insights that you can use in your day-to-day work.

## What I’m Exploring Now (2026 Focus)

I believe a Lead Engineer never stops being a student. Right now, I am focusing my research and writing on:

* **Enterprise Architecture:** Pursuing **TOGAF** certification to master the "Big Picture" of business and IT alignment.
* **Agentic AI:** Building autonomous workflows using **LangGraph** and **Agentic AI** frameworks within Java ecosystems.
* **Cloud Excellence:** Advanced scaling and cost-optimization strategies on **AWS**.
