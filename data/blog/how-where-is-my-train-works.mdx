## Introduction 🚆

If you have ever traveled by train in India, you know this problem very well:

> “Is my train on time? Where exactly is it right now?”

Many people use **Where Is My Train** because it gives accurate live train status, sometimes even **without internet**.

In this post, everything is explained in **simple language**, so even a non‑technical person can understand how the app works.

---

## The Big Idea (In One Line)

👉 The app does **not depend only on railway servers**  
👉 It uses **your phone’s location**, **mobile signals**, and **data from other passengers**

---

## Simple Real-Life Example 🧠

Think of it like this:

- You are sitting in a train
- Your phone knows:
  - How fast you are moving
  - In which direction you are going
- The app already knows:
  - Train routes
  - Station names
  - Train timings

So the app can say:

> “You are on Train 12951 and it is currently near Surat.”

## Overall System (Big Picture)

1. Your phone collects location and speed
2. The app matches this with train routes
3. Arrival time is predicted
4. Data is shared anonymously when internet is available

---

## How the App Works Without Internet 📵

The app stores important data inside your phone:

- Train routes
- Station list
- Train numbers
- Distance between stations

Because of this, the app works even when there is **no internet**.

## Step-by-Step: How the App Finds Your Train

1. Phone checks movement speed
2. Matches nearby railway tracks
3. Identifies the most likely train

All this happens **inside your phone**.

## GPS + Mobile Tower Signals 📍

- **GPS** gives accurate location
- **Mobile towers** work inside tunnels

The app combines both for better accuracy.

---

## How Crowd Data Improves Accuracy 👥

When many people are on the same train:

- Locations are combined
- Average speed is calculated
- Delay is predicted

More users = better accuracy.

---

## How Arrival Time (ETA) Is Calculated ⏱️

![ETA calculation](/static/images/eta-calculation.png)

ETA is calculated using:

- Current speed
- Distance to next station
- Usual stop time
- Past delays

---

## Why This Works So Well in India 🇮🇳

- Fixed railway tracks
- Huge number of passengers
- Good mobile network coverage

---

## Comparison With Other Train Apps

| Feature                | Where Is My Train | Traditional Apps |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Works without internet | Yes               | No               |
| Uses phone GPS         | Yes               | No               |
| Crowd based updates    | Yes               | No               |
