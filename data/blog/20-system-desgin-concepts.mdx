# Introduction

System design is not just for interviews—it’s a daily skill for building scalable, reliable, and maintainable software. Whether you are building a small startup app or a massive distributed system, these 20 concepts form the foundation of modern software architecture.

In this guide, we break down **20 essential system design concepts** with clear definitions, real-world examples, diagrams, and—most importantly—**how to explain them in an interview**.

---

## 1. Load Balancing

**Definition:**  
The process of distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed.

**Real-World Example:**
- **Nginx/HAProxy:** Distributing HTTP requests to a cluster of web servers.
- **AWS ELB:** automatically routing user traffic to healthy EC2 instances.

**Visual:**
```
       [User]
          |
    [Load Balancer]
      /   |   \
[Server1] [Server2] [Server3]
```

**💡 Interview Tip:**  
"I use load balancing to improve availability and fault tolerance. If one server goes down, the balancer detects the failure and reroutes traffic to healthy instances, ensuring zero downtime."

## 2. Caching

**Definition:**  
Storing copies of frequently accessed data in a temporary, high-speed storage layer (RAM) to speed up subsequent requests.

**Real-World Example:**
- **Redis:** Storing user session data or leaderboard scores in memory.
- **Browser Cache:** Storing static assets (CSS, images) locally on the user's device.

**Visual:**
```
[App] -> [Cache (Redis)] --(Hit)--> Return Data
                |
             (Miss)
                v
            [Database]
```

**💡 Interview Tip:**  
"Caching trades memory for speed. I’d implement a 'Cache-Aside' strategy: check cache first; if missing, fetch from DB and update cache. This significantly reduces database load."

## 3. Database Sharding

**Definition:**  
Splitting a large dataset into smaller, manageable chunks (shards) distributed across multiple servers, usually based on a "shard key" (e.g., User ID).

**Real-World Example:**
- **Instagram:** Sharding photo metadata based on User ID.
- **Discord:** Sharding message history based on Channel ID.

**💡 Interview Tip:**  
"Sharding effectively solves horizontal scaling for write-heavy databases. However, it introduces complexity in joins and transactions. I would choose a sharding key carefully to avoid 'hot shards'."

  height={400}
/>

---

## 4. Replication

**Definition:**  
Keeping copies of the same data on multiple machines to ensure data availability and redundancy.

**Real-World Example:**
- **Master-Slave:** One primary DB for writes, multiple read-replicas for reads (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- **Multi-Region:** Replicating data across US-East and EU-West for disaster recovery.

**💡 Interview Tip:**  
"Replication increases read throughput and data durability. I would use asynchronous replication for performance, acknowledging the trade-off of potential 'eventual consistency'."

  height={400}
/>

## 5. CAP Theorem

**Definition:**  
A distributed system can deliver only two of three guarantees: **Consistency** (every read receives the most recent write), **Availability** (every request receives a response), and **Partition Tolerance** (system continues despite network failures).

**Real-World Example:**
- **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance):** Banking systems (ATM) where accuracy is critical.
- **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance):** Social media structure where seeing a slightly old post is acceptable.

**💡 Interview Tip:**  
"In a distributed system, network partitions are inevitable (P). So the real choice is between C and A. For a payment system, I'd pick Consistency (CP); for a news feed, availability (AP)."

## 6. Consistent Hashing

**Definition:**  
A hashing technique used in distributed systems (like caches) to minimize data movement when nodes are added or removed. Ideally, only `K/n` keys need remapping.

**Real-World Example:**
- **DynamoDB / Cassandra:** Distributing data across nodes in a ring topology.
- **Discord:** Routing voice chat traffic to specific nodes.

**💡 Interview Tip:**  
"Standard hashing (`key % n`) breaks when `n` changes, causing massive cache misses. Consistent hashing solves this by placing nodes on a ring, ensuring unrelated keys stay put during scaling events."

  alt="Consistent Hashing Diagram"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

## 7. Message Queues

**Definition:**  
A buffer that enables asynchronous communication between services. Producers send messages; consumers process them at their own pace.

**Real-World Example:**
- **Email Sending:** User clicks "Sign Up" → Job added to queue → Worker sends email later.
- **Video Processing:** Youtube upload → Queue → Background transcoding service.

**Visual:**
```
[Order Svc] --> [Queue (Kafka/SQS)] --> [Shipping Svc]
```

**💡 Interview Tip:**  
"Message queues decouple services. If the consumer service crashes, messages persist in the queue until it recovers, preventing data loss and allowing for load leveling."

  src="/static/images/system-design/message-queue.jpeg"
  alt="Message Queue Diagram"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

---

## 8. Rate Limiting

**Definition:**  
Controlling the number of requests a user can send to a system within a specific time frame to prevent abuse.

**Real-World Example:**
- **Twitter API:** Limiting users to 500 tweets per day.
- **Login:** Blocking IP after 5 failed password attempts.

**💡 Interview Tip:**  
"I would implement rate limiting (e.g., Token Bucket algorithm) at the API Gateway level to protect backend services from DDoS attacks and noisy neighbors."

  alt="Rate Limiting Diagram"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

---

## 9. API Gateway

**Definition:**  
A single entry point for client requests that routes them to appropriate microservices. It often handles cross-cutting concerns like auth, logging, and rate limiting.

**Real-World Example:**
- **Netflix Zuul:** Routes millions of requests to catalog, user, and playback services.
- **AWS API Gateway:** Frontend for Serverless functions.

**💡 Interview Tip:**  
"Using an API Gateway usually simplifies the client side—they only need to know one domain (`api.mysite.com`). It also offloads security and SSL termination from individual microservices."

  src="/static/images/system-design/api-gateway.jpeg"
  alt="API Gateway Diagram"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

---

## 10. Microservices

**Definition:**  
An architectural style where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services that communicate over APIs.

**Real-World Example:**
- **Uber:** Separate services for Passenger Management, Driver Tracking, and Payments.
- **Amazon:** Hundreds of services for Product Page, Recommendations, Cart, etc.

**Internal Link:**  
See [Service Mesh Explained](/blog/service-mesh-pattern) for how to manage communication between these services.

**💡 Interview Tip:**  
"Microservices allow teams to deploy independently and choose the best tech stack for each problem. However, they drastically increase operational complexity compared to a monolith."

  src="/static/images/system-design/microservices.jpeg"
  alt="Microservices Diagram"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

---

## 11. Service Discovery

**Definition:**  
A mechanism for services to automatically detect and find the network location (IP + Port) of other services in a dynamic environment (like Kubernetes).

**Real-World Example:**
- **Consul / Eureka:** Registry where services register themselves on startup.
- **Kubernetes DNS:** Resolving `my-service.default.svc.cluster.local`.

**💡 Interview Tip:**  
"Hardcoding IPs is impossible in cloud environments where instances spin up and down. Service Discovery acts as a dynamic phonebook for the cluster."

  height={400}
/>

## 12. CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)

**Definition:**  
A geographically distributed network of proxy servers that serve static content from a location closest to the user.

**Real-World Example:**
- **Cloudflare / Akamai:** Serving images, CSS, and JS files from a server in London for a user in London, even if the main DB is in New York.
- **Video Streaming:** Netflix Open Connect.

**💡 Interview Tip:**  
"CDNs drastically reduce latency (TTFB) and offload static traffic from your origin servers. For a global app, a CDN is mandatory for a good UX."

  height={400}
/>

---

## 13. Database Indexing

**Definition:**  
A data structure (like B-Tree) that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space.

**Real-World Example:**
- Indexing the `email` column in a user table to make `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email=?` instant.

**💡 Interview Tip:**  
"Indexes turn O(N) full table scans into O(log N) lookups. However, over-indexing slows down `INSERT` and `UPDATE` operations, so it requires balance."

<Image
  src="/static/images/system-design/database-indexing.jpeg"
  alt="Database Indexing Diagram"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

---

## 14. Partitioning

**Definition:**  
The general concept of dividing data. Sharding (mentioned above) is a form of horizontal partitioning. Vertical partitioning splits tables by columns (e.g., storing CLOBs separately).

**Real-World Example:**
- **Time-based partitioning:** Storing logs in daily tables (`access_logs_2025_12_27`).

**💡 Interview Tip:**  
"Partitioning improves query performance by allowing the DB engine to 'prune' unnecessary partitions. If I query for December data, the DB skips scanning January-November."

<Image
  src="/static/images/system-design/partitioning.jpeg"
  alt="Partitioning Diagram"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

---

## 15. Eventual Consistency

**Definition:**  
A consistency model used in distributed computing where the system guarantees that if no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses to that item will return the last updated value.

**Real-World Example:**
- **DNS Propagation:** Changing a domain IP takes minutes/hours to reflect globally.
- **Social Media Follows:** You follow someone, but your friend doesn't see it on their feed for a few seconds.

**💡 Interview Tip:**  
"We accept eventual consistency in exchange for high availability (BASE vs ACID). It's fine for 'Likes', but usually not for 'Bank Balances'."

<Image
  src="/static/images/system-design/eventual-consistency.jpeg"
  alt="Eventual Consistency Diagram"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

---

## 16. WebSockets

**Definition:**  
A persistent, full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection, allowing the server to push updates to the client in real-time.

**Real-World Example:**
- **Chat Apps:** WhatsApp / Slack.
- **Live Sports Scores:** Updating scoreboards without refreshing the page.

**Visual:**
```
[Client] <====(Persistent Connection)====> [Server]
```

**💡 Interview Tip:**  
"Unlike HTTP Polling (Client asking 'Any new data?'), WebSockets allow the server to say 'Here is new data!'. This reduces latency and unnecessary network overhead."

<Image
  src="/static/images/system-design/web-socket.jpeg"
  alt="WebSockets Diagram"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

---

## 17. Scalability

**Definition:**  
The capability of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources.

**Types:**
- **Vertical (Scale Up):** Adding more RAM/CPU to a single server.
- **Horizontal (Scale Out):** Adding more servers to the pool.

**💡 Interview Tip:**  
"Vertical scaling hits a hardware limit and represents a single point of failure. Horizontal scaling is infinite in theory but introduces software complexity (statelessness, load balancing)."

  src="/static/images/system-design/scalability.jpeg"
  alt="Scalability Diagram"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

---

## 18. Fault Tolerance

**Definition:**  
The ability of a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components.

**Real-World Example:**
- **RAID:** Hard drive failure doesn't result in data loss.
- **Kubernetes:** Automatically restarting crashed pods.

**💡 Interview Tip:**  
"To achieve fault tolerance, I assume every component will eventually fail. We use redundancy (Replication) and isolation (Bulkheads) to ensure a partial failure doesn't become a total outage."

<Image
  src="/static/images/system-design/fault-tolerance.jpeg"
  alt="Fault Tolerance Diagram"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

---

## 19. Monitoring & Observability

**Definition:**  
Collecting metrics, logs, and traces to understand the internal state of the system and detect issues before users do.

**Real-World Example:**
- **Prometheus/Grafana:** Visualizing CPU usage and Request Latency (p99).
- **Datadog/NewRelic:** Full stack monitoring.

**💡 Interview Tip:**  
"You can't fix what you can't measure. In a distributed system, tracing (tracking a request across services) is vital to identify bottlenecks."

  src="/static/images/system-design/monitoring.jpeg"
  alt="Monitoring Diagram"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

---

## 20. Circuit Breaker Pattern

**Definition:**  
A design pattern used to detect failures and encapsulate the logic of preventing a failure from constantly recurring (e.g., during maintenance or temporary external system failure).

**Real-World Example:**
- **Netflix Hystrix:** If the Recommendation Service is slow/down, the Netflix app stops calling it and shows a "Popular Movies" fallback list instead of a spinning loader.

**Visual:**
```
[Circuit Closed] -> Flow Normal
[Circuit Open]   -> Fail Fast (Return Error/Fallback immediately)
[Half Open]      -> Test if system is back up
```

**💡 Interview Tip:**  
"It pushes back pressure. Instead of overwhelming a struggling service with retries, the circuit breaker opens to give the downstream service time to recover."

# Final Thoughts

Mastering these 20 concepts helps you move from being a "coder" to an "architect." In system design interviews, knowing the **definition** gets you points, but explaining the **trade-offs** (the "Interview Tips" above) gets you the job.

**Next Steps:**
- Read about [Service Mesh](/blog/service-mesh-pattern) to see how many of these concepts come together in infrastructure.
- Check out the [Algorithm visualizer](https://algorithm-visualizer.org/) to see consistent hashing in action.
